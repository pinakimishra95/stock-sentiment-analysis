What Is Sentiment Analysis ?
Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer’s attitude towards a particular topic, product, subject etc. is positive, negative, or neutral. — Wikipedia
“Sentiment analysis is the measurement of neutral, negative, and positive language. It is a way to evaluate spoken or written language to determine if the expression is favorable (positive), unfavorable (negative), or neutral, and to what degree.” — Clarabridge
“Sentiment analysis: the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer’s attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.” — Oxford English Dictionary
I decided to use a data set that contains top news articles on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and a label column that shows when the DJIA adjusted close price rose or stayed the same (represented by the number ‘1’) and when it decreased (represented by the number ‘0’).
If you prefer not to read this post and would like a video representation of it, you can check out the YouTube Video below.

Or you can use both as supplementary materials for learning!
